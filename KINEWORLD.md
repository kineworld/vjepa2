## 致谢 / Acknowledgements

感谢 **Meta FAIR** 以及所有贡献者的开源精神。你们公开研究成果、代码与复现方法，让更多研究者和小团队能够学习、验证和继续改进。勘境珍惜这些贡献，保留原始作者、提交历史、许可证与引用信息；我们的新增工作以可检查的改动和测试记录说明。

We thank Meta FAIR and the broader open-source community for sharing their work. Original contributions remain attributed to their authors. KineWorld's changes are documented separately, with their validation limits.

## Implemented change

Fix the checked-in localhost download URL. Add checkpoint_path to V-JEPA 2, 2-AC and 2.1 builders. Local checkpoint errors never trigger a network fallback; tensor-only loading is requested. Reject checkpoint_path with pretrained=False.

## Validation

3 focused tests passed locally. Run `python -m unittest discover -s tests_kineworld -v` (Python 3.10+; NumPy is required for OpenDW statistics).

These are engineering/numerical checks, not a model-quality benchmark. No full checkpoint reproduction, new weights, measured leaderboard improvement or upstream endorsement is claimed. Original model descriptions and scores in the upstream README remain the authors' results.
